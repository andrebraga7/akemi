## Design choices

- ### Typography

    The font chosen for this project was [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter/) designed by [Rasmus Andersson](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Rasmus+Andersson). It has a fall back font of sans-serif. This font was chosen because it has a similar design to the company's logotype. It also has some great readability features like stated by the designer:
    >Inter features a tall x-height to aid in readability of mixed-case and lower-case text. Several OpenType features are provided as well.

- ### Colour scheme
    The colour scheme chosen follows and builds upon the companys visual idendity, which relates to the application of renewable energies.
